# ðŸ§ª Lab Report: FSM_ChessTimer (Finite State Machine for Two-Player Timer)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Objective
The objective of this lab is to **design, implement, and analyze** a *Finite State Machine (FSM)* in Verilog that functions as a **two-player chess timer**.  
The FSM controls two countdown counters, enabling only one playerâ€™s timer at a time, switching turns based on button presses, and detecting the end of the game when a playerâ€™s time runs out.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Background and Theory
A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a sequential logic circuit that transitions between a finite number of states based on input conditions.  
FSMs are broadly divided into:
- **Moore Machines**: outputs depend only on the current state.
- **Mealy Machines**: outputs depend on both current state and inputs.

This design follows a **Moore-type FSM**, since outputs depend solely on the current state (e.g., enabling counters and controlling displays).

The FSM has four states:
1. `IDLE` â€“ Both counters are loaded but not running.  
2. `PLAYER1` â€“ Player 1â€™s timer is active.  
3. `PLAYER2` â€“ Player 2â€™s timer is active.  
4. `END` â€“ The game has ended (one playerâ€™s timer expired).

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Equipment and Software
- **Hardware Description Language**: Verilog HDL  
- **Simulation Tool**: ModelSim / Quartus Prime / Vivado  
- **Target Platform**: FPGA board (optional)  
- **Inputs**: Clock signal, reset, player buttons, counter values  
- **Outputs**: Load, enable, and display control signals

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Discussion
The FSM design functions correctly for all defined states and transitions.  
It ensures mutual exclusivity between counters and prevents overlapping enable signals.  
Using Moore-type output logic guarantees stable outputs that change only with state updates.

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Conclusion
The FSM_ChessTimer module successfully controls two player timers, switching turns accurately and stopping the game when a player runs out of time.  
The simulation confirmed all expected transitions and output logic.

## ðŸ”¹ 11. Future Improvements
- Add button debouncing.
- Include LED indicators for active player.
- Integrate pause/resume functionality.
- Add sound output for time expiration.
